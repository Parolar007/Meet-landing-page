# Frontend Mentor Challenge – Landing Page

This project was built as part of a **Frontend Mentor** challenge. The main goal was to practice layout structure, responsiveness, and CSS positioning, with special attention to the hero section.

## 🚀 What I’m most proud of

I’m proud of the persistence I had while working on this project. I spent around three days experimenting with different approaches to make the layout look as close as possible to the original design, especially the hero section.

Even though I’m not fully satisfied with the final result yet, the process helped me understand responsive layout behavior much better.

To explore solutions more freely, I created a separate **“LAB” test file**, where I experimented with different ways of handling the two images in the hero section as the viewport width changes. I’m still refining that approach and plan to deploy an improved version later.

**What I would do differently next time:**
I would plan the hero section architecture more carefully from the beginning, instead of refining it after most of the layout was already built.

## 🧩 Challenges faced and how I overcame them

At the beginning of the project, the code was quite verbose and messy. As the project evolved, I refactored parts of it to make the code more readable and organized, although there is still room for improvement.

The main challenge was the **hero section**. I spent around three days trying to find a solution that felt acceptable to me, especially regarding responsiveness across **mobile, tablet, and desktop**.

In the end, I decided to deploy a stable version and move forward, instead of overengineering the solution. This allowed me to keep learning through new projects while continuing to experiment and improve the hero section separately.

To overcome these challenges, I spent many hours practicing, testing different approaches, and reading documentation on **MDN Web Docs**. Even though the result is not perfect, the learning process was definitely worth it.

## 🧠 Areas where I’d like feedback

I would really appreciate feedback on the **hero section**, specifically:

- How to structure it more effectively
- How to make it match the original design more closely
- How to keep it fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop without overcomplicating the layout

## 📚 What I learned

- Responsive layout behavior using modern CSS
- The importance of layout architecture before fine-tuning details
- When to stop refining and move forward with a stable solution
- How experimenting in isolated test files can speed up learning
